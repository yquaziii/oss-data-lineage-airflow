# Core Functionalities

## Lineage Tracing:

- **Automatic Capture:** Develop modules or plugins to parse code, queries, and API calls to track data movements and transformations across systems (databases, ETL tools, cloud warehouses).
- **Granularity:** Decide on the level of lineage tracking (e.g., column, table, dataset) based on the needs of your users.
- **Versioning:** Implement a mechanism to track changes in data schemas and transformations over time.

## Metadata Management:

- **Storage:** Utilize a graph database or a specialized metadata store to store metadata information.
- **Cataloging:** Define a structured approach for storing metadata including table names, column names, data types, classifications (e.g., sensitive, PII), descriptions, ownership, and quality scores.
- **Search & Discovery:** Develop a user-friendly interface for users to explore metadata, relationships, and visualize lineage graphs.

## Standalone vs. Airflow Integration

- **Standalone:**
  - **Pros:** Potentially wider user base, as it can be used with various workflow tools beyond Airflow.
  - **Cons:** Requires additional effort to connect with existing Airflow environments for lineage visualization.
  
- **Airflow Integration:**
  - **Pros:** Seamless integration with Airflow's DAGs for easier visualization and management of data pipelines.
  - **Cons:** Limited to users of the Airflow ecosystem, potentially reducing the tool's reach.

# Steps to Build

1. **Define Requirements:** Collaborate with data engineers, data scientists, and data stewards to understand their needs for data lineage and metadata management.
2. **Choose Technologies:** Select suitable technologies for metadata storage, lineage tracking, and user interface development based on scalability, performance, and ease of integration.
3. **Develop Modules:** Implement modules or plugins for lineage tracking, metadata storage, and user interface.
4. **Testing:** Perform extensive testing to ensure the tool captures lineage accurately and provides reliable metadata management.
5. **Documentation:** Create detailed documentation on how to use the tool, integrate it with existing systems, and contribute to its development.
6. **Community Engagement:** Foster a community around the tool to gather feedback, address issues, and drive further development.

# Example Architecture

- **Data Sources:** Various sources such as databases, file systems, APIs.
- **Lineage Tracker:** Module/plugin to track data movements and transformations.
- **Metadata Store:** Repository to store metadata information.
- **User Interface:** Interface for users to explore metadata, visualize lineage graphs, and manage data pipelines.

# Conclusion

Building an Open Source Data Lineage and Metadata Tracker involves a deep understanding of data engineering principles, metadata management, and software development. By focusing on core functionalities and engaging with the community, you can create a valuable tool for the data engineering community.
